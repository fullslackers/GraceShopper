As the box reads: \"When Tetsuya Miyamoto invented the KenKen® puzzle in his mathematics classroom in 2004, his goal was to improve his students’ problem solving and logic skills. He describes his method as “The Art of Teaching without Teaching,” and his dream is to make the world smarter with his invention. Today, the KenKen® puzzle is the only puzzle printed daily alongside the New York Times Crossword. Puzzles like these inspire us to apply problem solving and logic in creative ways, letting our minds perform a beautiful dance between their left and right hemispheres. Blackwing 10001 (壱万壱) pays tribute to Miyamoto Sensei’s puzzles and other creative ways of teaching and learning. 10001 is a numeral palindrome in Kanji as well as in Arabic numerals. It is also tied to one of Miyamoto Sensei’s favorite equations. The pencil features a red stained barrel, gold imprint and unique five-sided “Gōkaku pencil” shape. Translated literally from Japanese, Gōkaku means “passed,” as in a problem or exam. It is also a near-homophone for the Japanese word “Gokakukei,” meaning pentagon. Gōkaku pencils are given to every student who graduates from the Miyamoto Mathematics class.\" Made in Japan from California cedar Grade: Ungraded but feels a B or even a 2B (same hardness as a Blackwing 602) Replacement erasers are available here Each pencil measures 8\" long Pentagonal barrel, normal diameter Sold by the dozen",

        "The autumn edition of the ever-popular Blackwing Volumes series is a tribute to another popular analog relic: the vinyl record! Here's the story, from the source: \" From their introduction in the late 1800s, analog records have withstood the advent of radio, the rise and fall of CDs and MP3s, and the dawn of streaming. Rather than be displaced by these more convenient ways of consuming music, the vinyl record has instead shifted from an object of convenience to one of connection. And it has thrived in the process. Just as the way we engage with pencils and notebooks is different from the way we interact with keyboards and touch screens, the way we engage with records is different from the way we interact with digital music. From the rich, uncompressed sound to the album art and liner notes, records tell a story both physically and sonically. According to music icon Henry Rollins, of all the ways to listen to music, “vinyl [best] represents what the musicians wanted you to hear.” The vinyl experience not only creates a physical and emotional connection between music and people, it creates a connection between musicians and their fans. The Blackwing 33 1/3 is a tribute to vinyl records. It features a matte black finish and matte black ferrule to go with its black imprint and black eraser. The gloss black foil banding near the grip was inspired by the grooves on a record.\" Made in Japan from California cedar Grade: Ungraded but feels like a 2B (the same core as the Blackwing Pearl) Replacement erasers are available here Each pencil measures 8\" long Hexagonal barrel, normal diameter Sold by the dozen",

        "Meet the winter 2018/2019 edition of the Blackwing Volumes series! This one has a unique texture, a colored ferrule and a great story, straight from the source: \"In 2020, NASA will send a rover to Mars to search for evidence of ancient Martian life while testing technologies for future human expeditions. While the engineering designs for the rover and its various instruments are finalized in CAD, its revolutionary robotic arm and zoom-enabled cameras – the first of their kind to be sent to another planet – were first conceptualized in drawings by the team at Motiv Space Systems using Blackwing pencils. Earlier this year, Motiv delivered their assemblies based on these drawings to begin integration onto the rover. In 2020, they will join the Wright brothers’ wrapping paper sketches and Katherine Johnson’s brilliant calculations as examples of the pencil’s ability to help us reach the sky, space and beyond. The Blackwing 4 is a tribute to Mars and the upcoming rover mission. It features a rust-colored lacquer and sand-textured finish inspired by the surface of the fourth planet. It also features our first ever bronze ferrule, a cream imprint and eraser, and our soft graphite.\" Made in Japan from California cedar Grade: Ungraded but feels like a 3B-ish (the same core as the black Blackwing) Replacement erasers are available here Each pencil measures 8\" long Hexagonal barrel, normal diameter Sold by the dozen",

The Futura was first made in the 1950s by Richard Best Pencil Company--the same pencil company that made the first triangular pencil, the Try-Rex. The Futura was their snazzy pink version of their flagship pencil, with its wonderful typography and often flashy ferrule. The Futura existed in a few slightly different forms during its existence and is still a highly sought after vintage. Somewhere along the line J.R Moon of Lewisburg, Tennessee acquired the rights to the Try-Rex and the rest of Richard Best's companies so we approached them about bringing our favorite Futura back in a modern way. Though the ability to do a super custom ferrule is limited these days and the odd shaped printing plate necessary for the beveled ages is just short of impossible, we hope you enjoy our 2017 version of this glossy pink beauty.

Pencils designated for certain uses were meant to have certain characteristics and qualities that were consistent with other brands and reflected in their price.

        "The copying pencil is an excellent example of a specialty pencil from a bygone era. It was originally made to contain vibrant purple aniline dye, so that it could be used for permanent marking and also to be transferrable when wet. The height of its popularity was in the very early 1900s when it served as an easy, permanent writing tool and as a way to copy documents. The Mephisto was one of the most popular models in the US during this era--this version is a purple of with a hard lead, which is generally preferable for copying pencils. Note: since this pencil was produced, aniline dye has been found to be quite toxic. It's absolutely safe to use the pencil for its intended purpose, just be sure you don't ingest it. Vintage: 1920s Made in the USA Measures 8\" long Hexagonal barrel Please note that all vintage pencils may have minor flaws due to age and that you can expect the erasers to not work anymore. The pencil you will receive will not necessarily be the one in the photo but definitely one from the same dozen. We've tried our best to accurately capture the quality of the pencil and promise not to sell you something of lesser quality. For Blackwings especially, the ferrules were rarely put on straight. Please do not be alarmed if your ferrule isn't aligned with the text, it won't affect the function or value of the pencil.",

Cased in California cedar, the graphite writes a bit darker and smoother then your average #2 but manages to hold its point pretty well. The rubber eraser on the end is effective and durable. This pencil is excellent for general use if you prefer a slightly softer pencil and is also recommended for use with crossword puzzles and standardized tests.

        "The copying pencil is an excellent example of a specialty pencil from a bygone era. It was originally made to contain vibrant purple aniline dye, so that it could be used for permanent marking and also to be transferrable when wet. The height of its popularity was in the very early 1900s when it served as an easy, permanent writing tool and as a way to copy documents. This later example comes with its own little cap to prevent an inky mess and contains red dye. According to the text on the back of the pencil, it's meant \"for hectograph use\". Note: since this pencil was produced, aniline dye has been found to be quite toxic. It's absolutely safe to use the pencil for its intended purpose, just be sure you don't ingest it. Vintage: 1960s Made in the USA Measures 8\" long Hexagonal barrel Please note that all vintage pencils may have minor flaws due to age and that you can expect the erasers to not work anymore. The pencil you will receive will not necessarily be the one in the photo but definitely one from the same dozen. We've tried our best to accurately capture the quality of the pencil and promise not to sell you something of lesser quality. For Blackwings especially, the ferrules were rarely put on straight. Please do not be alarmed if your ferrule isn't aligned with the text, it won't affect the function or value of the pencil.",

They had violet aniline dye in the core that can transfer when wetted and pressed against another piece of paper. They were most used during WWI as a way to write, sign and make copies of documents quickly and easily as the only other permanent option at the time was a fountain pen, which was messy and more difficult to carry around. Though the aniline dyes originally used have since proven to be toxic, a small number of pencil companies still make contemporary versions.

        "The Summer 2018 Blackwing Volumes release is naturally beautiful, features a unique pentagonal shape and has a particularly interesting background story. As the box reads: \"When Tetsuya Miyamoto invented the KenKen® puzzle in his mathematics classroom in 2004, his goal was to improve his students’ problem solving and logic skills. He describes his method as “The Art of Teaching without Teaching,” and his dream is to make the world smarter with his invention. Today, the KenKen® puzzle is the only puzzle printed daily alongside the New York Times Crossword. Puzzles like these inspire us to apply problem solving and logic in creative ways, letting our minds perform a beautiful dance between their left and right hemispheres. Blackwing 10001 (壱万壱) pays tribute to Miyamoto Sensei’s puzzles and other creative ways of teaching and learning. 10001 is a numeral palindrome in Kanji as well as in Arabic numerals. It is also tied to one of Miyamoto Sensei’s favorite equations. The pencil features a red stained barrel, gold imprint and unique five-sided “Gōkaku pencil” shape. Translated literally from Japanese, Gōkaku means “passed,” as in a problem or exam. It is also a near-homophone for the Japanese word “Gokakukei,” meaning pentagon. Gōkaku pencils are given to every student who graduates from the Miyamoto Mathematics class.\" Made in Japan from California cedar Grade: Ungraded but feels a B or even a 2B (same hardness as a Blackwing 602) Replacement erasers are available here Each pencil measures 8\" long Pentagonal barrel, normal diameter Sold by the dozen",

        "The autumn edition of the ever-popular Blackwing Volumes series is a tribute to another popular analog relic: the vinyl record! Here's the story, from the source: \" From their introduction in the late 1800s, analog records have withstood the advent of radio, the rise and fall of CDs and MP3s, and the dawn of streaming. Rather than be displaced by these more convenient ways of consuming music, the vinyl record has instead shifted from an object of convenience to one of connection. And it has thrived in the process. Just as the way we engage with pencils and notebooks is different from the way we interact with keyboards and touch screens, the way we engage with records is different from the way we interact with digital music. From the rich, uncompressed sound to the album art and liner notes, records tell a story both physically and sonically. According to music icon Henry Rollins, of all the ways to listen to music, “vinyl [best] represents what the musicians wanted you to hear.” The vinyl experience not only creates a physical and emotional connection between music and people, it creates a connection between musicians and their fans. The Blackwing 33 1/3 is a tribute to vinyl records. It features a matte black finish and matte black ferrule to go with its black imprint and black eraser. The gloss black foil banding near the grip was inspired by the grooves on a record.\" Made in Japan from California cedar Grade: Ungraded but feels like a 2B (the same core as the Blackwing Pearl) Replacement erasers are available here Each pencil measures 8\" long Hexagonal barrel, normal diameter Sold by the dozen",

While the engineering designs for the rover and its various instruments are finalized in CAD, its revolutionary robotic arm and zoom-enabled cameras – the first of their kind to be sent to another planet – were first conceptualized in drawings by the team at Motiv Space Systems using Blackwing pencils. Earlier this year, Motiv delivered their assemblies based on these drawings to begin integration onto the rover. In 2020, they will join the Wright brothers’ wrapping paper sketches and Katherine Johnson’s brilliant calculations as examples of the pencil’s ability to help us reach the sky, space and beyond. The Blackwing 4 is a tribute to Mars and the upcoming rover mission. It features a rust-colored lacquer and sand-textured finish inspired by the surface of the fourth planet.

        "Blaisdell was a pencil company founded in Pennsylvania in the 1890s, during a period of great growth in the American pencil industry. They became known for inventing the China Marker, though their other claim to fame is this pencil: the Blaisdell Calculator 600 \"Special Grade\", a rare specimen known for being part of the \"Steinbeck Trio\", a favorite of John Steinbeck. These pencils are un-graded but they're dark and smooth, with a unique drag to them. Vintage: 1970s Made in the USA Measures 7 1/2\" long Round barrel Please note that all vintage pencils may have minor flaws due to age and that you can expect the erasers to not work anymore. The pencil you will receive will not necessarily be the one in the photo but definitely one from the same dozen. We've tried our best to accurately capture the quality of the pencil and promise not to sell you something of lesser quality. For Blackwings especially, the ferrules were rarely put on straight. Please do not be alarmed if your ferrule isn't aligned with the text, it won't affect the function or value of the pencil.",

The Futura was first made in the 1950s by Richard Best Pencil Company--the same pencil company that made the first triangular pencil, the Try-Rex. The Futura was their snazzy pink version of their flagship pencil, with its wonderful typography and often flashy ferrule. The Futura existed in a few slightly different forms during its existence and is still a highly sought after vintage. Somewhere along the line J.R Moon of Lewisburg, Tennessee acquired the rights to the Try-Rex and the rest of Richard Best's companies so we approached them about bringing our favorite Futura back in a modern way. Though the ability to do a super custom ferrule is limited these days and the odd shaped printing plate necessary for the beveled ages is just short of impossible, we hope you enjoy our 2017 version of this glossy pink beauty.

        "This pencil is a nostalgic but currently manufactured version of the classic American yellow #2. Family-owned General Pencil Company has been making pencils in Jersey City, NJ since 1889 and is one of only three pencil companies still left in the United States. All of their pencils are made of high quality California incense cedar and are made to as high a standard as they were 100 years ago. The Goddess is a rare version of a still-made round pencil. Though difficult to find (especially with an attached eraser), round pencils are often a bit more comfortable to hold than their hexagonal counterparts. Made in the USA Grade: a true #2/HB Measures 7 1/2\" long Sold individually Hexagonal barrel, normal diameter Pre-sharpened We measure the characteristics of the pencils we sell against a General's Semi-Hex #2, which is the pencil we consider to be a good quality pencil of true HB/#2 hardness, similar to that of most American #2 pencils.

        "The copying pencil is an excellent example of a specialty pencil from a bygone era. It was originally made to contain vibrant purple aniline dye, so that it could be used for permanent marking and also to be transferrable when wet. The height of its popularity was in the very early 1900s when it served as an easy, permanent writing tool and as a way to copy documents. The Mephisto was one of the most popular models in the US during this era--this version is a purple of with a hard lead, which is generally preferable for copying pencils. Note: since this pencil was produced, aniline dye has been found to be quite toxic. It's absolutely safe to use the pencil for its intended purpose, just be sure you don't ingest it. Vintage: 1920s Made in the USA Measures 8\" long Hexagonal barrel Please note that all vintage pencils may have minor flaws due to age and that you can expect the erasers to not work anymore. The pencil you will receive will not necessarily be the one in the photo but definitely one from the same dozen. We've tried our best to accurately capture the quality of the pencil and promise not to sell you something of lesser quality. For Blackwings especially, the ferrules were rarely put on straight. Please do not be alarmed if your ferrule isn't aligned with the text, it won't affect the function or value of the pencil.",

The height of its popularity was in the very early 1900s when it served as an easy, permanent writing tool and as a way to copy documents. This later example comes with its own little cap to prevent an inky mess and contains red dye. According to the text on the back of the pencil, it's meant \"for hectograph use\". Note: since this pencil was produced, aniline dye has been found to be quite toxic. It's absolutely safe to use the pencil for its intended purpose, just be sure you don't ingest it.

The pencils only came in 12 colors and were renowned for being the favorite colored pencil among animators and architects in Japan. Their hard, highly pigmented lead was preferred to fine line drawing. Panic ensued and stores very quickly sold out of every color. Within 24 hours, Mitsubishi decided to continue making the four most popular colors: red, orange, yellow-green and light blue. Here you’ll find the red version, the most coveted of them all.

        "Copying pencils were first introduced in the 1870s as a form of ‘ink’ pencil that couldn’t be erased. They had violet aniline dye in the core that can transfer when wetted and pressed against another piece of paper. They were most used during WWI as a way to write, sign and make copies of documents quickly and easily as the only other permanent option at the time was a fountain pen, which was messy and more difficult to carry around. Though the aniline dyes originally used have since proven to be toxic, a small number of pencil companies still make contemporary versions. The core in this one is a classic copying pencil purple and is non-toxic. Viarco is Portugal's one and only pencil factory.

        "What you're looking at is essentially a sophisticated, grown-up mini legal pad. It's a collaboration between Craft Design Technology (one of Japan's coolest office products brands) and Life Notebooks (one of Japan's most famous notebook companies). The paper is super smooth, creamy and exactly the right weight. It's printed in a very faint mint green grid (on both sides!) with a slight border around the edges and is well perforated for easy tearing. It's just as good for letter writing as it is for writing down your grocery list. You'll never use a regular legal pad again, guaranteed. Made in Japan A5 Size (5.8 x 8.3 inches) 50 pages",

        "Since software programs have come to dominate offices and studios, the pencil has become a symbol for creative freedom. In other words, the work you do on the computer is what you do for work, to pay the rent, whereas the stuff you do with your pencil is the stuff you do for fun. Apart from stimulating the world's most important creative minds, the pencil has become the modern creative's ultimate fetish. This book presents a unique collection of close-up pictures of pencils from some of our foremost artists, designers, writers, architects, and musicians. What makes these pictures compelling is the fact that they somehow reflect the creative personalities of their owners: Philippe Starck's is a stylish black and red, Paul Smith's is a classic jewel-like thing worth £3,000 (a present from Jonathan Ive), William Boyd's is nicely aged and rusty, while Anish Kapoor's is sculpted into a mini ArcelorMittal Orbital tower. The pictures are complemented by materials such as sketches, quotes and brief interviews, giving a further insight into the workings of these great creative minds.Hardback 143 Pages ISBN: 9781786270832 Published by Laurence King Publishing",

        "Samantha is a Brooklyn based graphic designer and illustrator who has amassed a following on social media through her daily sketch journaling. She's been a friend of the shop since the very beginning and we're so thrilled about her new pair of books. This pack includes a selection of some of Samantha's favorite pencils, a copy of her book Draw Your Day and the companion sketchbook. Let Samantha guide you through learning the art of sketch journaling with easy to follow instructions and advice and just the right tools to get started. The pencil set includes one of each of the following pencils: Palomino Blackwing Pearl Pencil - While this pencil has been compared to a 2B, I find it closer to a 3B in smoothness and darkness. It's a gorgeous object with a rich history--and it's lovely to photograph. General's Kimberly Pencil in B - Green is my favorite color and one of my closest friends shares its name, so I liked it from the moment I saw it. Caran d'Ache Swiss Wood Pencil - It's the hardest pencil I use but I find it so lovely to draw with. It's subtly heavier, holds its point longer than most pencils, is a beautiful dark wood with a red end and even smells nice. Viarco Art Graf 2B Pencil - This pencil writes similarly to a 2B and is a bit like charcoal. Also, it's water-soluble, which allows you to give your drawings a wash of water for a painterly effect. Tombow Mono KM-KKS 6B Pencil - To round out the collection, I wanted to have a very soft, dark graphite pencil. The Mono is exceptionally buttery, smooth and excellent for drawing. Viking Verso 4B/HB Pencil - I discovered this pencil the day we chose the pack. It's double-ended, so you'll need pencil caps for this one. One end is soft and the other is firmer for writing. Sakura Sumo Mini Eraser - A hard-working, portable plastic eraser perfect for eliminating dark graphite messes.",

The fluted California cedar pencil comes with a capped eraser on one end, and a combination point-protector, pocket clip, and sharpener on the other. Both the pencil and the eraser can be replaced (keep in mind that the cap will only fit on Graf von Faber-Castell pencil refills). The high-quality graphite and platinum-plated hardware make this the Perfect tool for those who write, draw, or simply enjoy fine analog tools. Prior to the 20th century, the famous pencil firm went by the name A.W Faber until heiress Baroness Ottilie von Faber married Count Alexander zu Castell-Rüdenhausen. They legally changed their last names to Faber-Castell in order to use it as the new name for the family business. The Graf von Faber-Castell line (translated literally as the Count of Faber-Castell) celebrates the tradition and history of this esteemed company. Made in Germany Measures 6 inches assembled Pencil measures 5 1/4 inches Cap measures 3 inches Sold individually This set comes with 1 pencil. You can find the appropriately sized refills here. Please note that this only fits GvF pencils.",
