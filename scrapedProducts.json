As the box reads: \"When Tetsuya Miyamoto invented the KenKenÂ® puzzle in his mathematics classroom in 2004, his goal was to improve his studentsâ problem solving and logic skills. He describes his method as âThe Art of Teaching without Teaching,â and his dream is to make the world smarter with his invention. Today, the KenKenÂ® puzzle is the only puzzle printed daily alongside the New York Times Crossword. Puzzles like these inspire us to apply problem solving and logic in creative ways, letting our minds perform a beautiful dance between their left and right hemispheres. Blackwing 10001 (å£±ä¸å£±) pays tribute to Miyamoto Senseiâs puzzles and other creative ways of teaching and learning. 10001 is a numeral palindrome in Kanji as well as in Arabic numerals. It is also tied to one of Miyamoto Senseiâs favorite equations. The pencil features a red stained barrel, gold imprint and unique five-sided âGÅkaku pencilâ shape. Translated literally from Japanese, GÅkaku means âpassed,â as in a problem or exam. It is also a near-homophone for the Japanese word âGokakukei,â meaning pentagon. GÅkaku pencils are given to every student who graduates from the Miyamoto Mathematics class.\" Made in Japan from California cedar Grade: Ungraded but feels a B or even a 2B (same hardness as a Blackwing 602) Replacement erasers are available here Each pencil measures 8\" long Pentagonal barrel, normal diameter Sold by the dozen",

        "The autumn edition of the ever-popular Blackwing Volumes series is a tribute to another popular analog relic: the vinyl record! Here's the story, from the source: \" From their introduction in the late 1800s, analog records have withstood the advent of radio, the rise and fall of CDs and MP3s, and the dawn of streaming. Rather than be displaced by these more convenient ways of consuming music, the vinyl record has instead shifted from an object of convenience to one of connection. And it has thrived in the process. Just as the way we engage with pencils and notebooks is different from the way we interact with keyboards and touch screens, the way we engage with records is different from the way we interact with digital music. From the rich, uncompressed sound to the album art and liner notes, records tell a story both physically and sonically. According to music icon Henry Rollins, of all the ways to listen to music, âvinyl [best] represents what the musicians wanted you to hear.â The vinyl experience not only creates a physical and emotional connection between music and people, it creates a connection between musicians and their fans. The Blackwing 33 1/3 is a tribute to vinyl records. It features a matte black finish and matte black ferrule to go with its black imprint and black eraser. The gloss black foil banding near the grip was inspired by the grooves on a record.\" Made in Japan from California cedar Grade: Ungraded but feels like a 2B (the same core as the Blackwing Pearl) Replacement erasers are available here Each pencil measures 8\" long Hexagonal barrel, normal diameter Sold by the dozen",

        "Meet the winter 2018/2019 edition of the Blackwing Volumes series! This one has a unique texture, a colored ferrule and a great story, straight from the source: \"In 2020, NASA will send a rover to Mars to search for evidence of ancient Martian life while testing technologies for future human expeditions. While the engineering designs for the rover and its various instruments are finalized in CAD, its revolutionary robotic arm and zoom-enabled cameras â the first of their kind to be sent to another planet â were first conceptualized in drawings by the team at Motiv Space Systems using Blackwing pencils. Earlier this year, Motiv delivered their assemblies based on these drawings to begin integration onto the rover. In 2020, they will join the Wright brothersâ wrapping paper sketches and Katherine Johnsonâs brilliant calculations as examples of the pencilâs ability to help us reach the sky, space and beyond. The Blackwing 4 is a tribute to Mars and the upcoming rover mission. It features a rust-colored lacquer and sand-textured finish inspired by the surface of the fourth planet. It also features our first ever bronze ferrule, a cream imprint and eraser, and our soft graphite.\" Made in Japan from California cedar Grade: Ungraded but feels like a 3B-ish (the same core as the black Blackwing) Replacement erasers are available here Each pencil measures 8\" long Hexagonal barrel, normal diameter Sold by the dozen",

The Futura was first made in the 1950s by Richard Best Pencil Company--the same pencil company that made the first triangular pencil, the Try-Rex. The Futura was their snazzy pink version of their flagship pencil, with its wonderful typography and often flashy ferrule. The Futura existed in a few slightly different forms during its existence and is still a highly sought after vintage. Somewhere along the line J.R Moon of Lewisburg, Tennessee acquired the rights to the Try-Rex and the rest of Richard Best's companies so we approached them about bringing our favorite Futura back in a modern way. Though the ability to do a super custom ferrule is limited these days and the odd shaped printing plate necessary for the beveled ages is just short of impossible, we hope you enjoy our 2017 version of this glossy pink beauty.

        "In 1889, the Koh-i-Noor 1500 pencil made its grand debut at the World's Fair in Paris. At this moment in history most radical innovations debuted similarly but for the pencil industry this was especially monumental. Not only was the 1500 the first pencil to be painted yellow but it was also the first pencil to be deliberately painted as a design choice. Painting a pencil normally signified that the pencil was imperfect and there was something to hide so makers of high quality pencils opted to leave them unpainted to show of the wood grain. Originally the ends were dipped in 24ct gold, they came in an unheard of 17 grades and were sold for at least three times that of comparable pencils of its time. Over a century later, the Koh-i-Noor Hardtmuth 1500 is still manufactured similarly to how it was in the 1880s and represents an undeniably important moment in pencil history.

        "The copying pencil is an excellent example of a specialty pencil from a bygone era. It was originally made to contain vibrant purple aniline dye, so that it could be used for permanent marking and also to be transferrable when wet. The height of its popularity was in the very early 1900s when it served as an easy, permanent writing tool and as a way to copy documents. The Mephisto was one of the most popular models in the US during this era--this version is a purple of with a hard lead, which is generally preferable for copying pencils. Note: since this pencil was produced, aniline dye has been found to be quite toxic. It's absolutely safe to use the pencil for its intended purpose, just be sure you don't ingest it. Vintage: 1920s Made in the USA Measures 8\" long Hexagonal barrel Please note that all vintage pencils may have minor flaws due to age and that you can expect the erasers to not work anymore. The pencil you will receive will not necessarily be the one in the photo but definitely one from the same dozen. We've tried our best to accurately capture the quality of the pencil and promise not to sell you something of lesser quality. For Blackwings especially, the ferrules were rarely put on straight. Please do not be alarmed if your ferrule isn't aligned with the text, it won't affect the function or value of the pencil.",

Cased in California cedar, the graphite writes a bit darker and smoother then your average #2 but manages to hold its point pretty well. The rubber eraser on the end is effective and durable. This pencil is excellent for general use if you prefer a slightly softer pencil and is also recommended for use with crossword puzzles and standardized tests.

        "The copying pencil is an excellent example of a specialty pencil from a bygone era. It was originally made to contain vibrant purple aniline dye, so that it could be used for permanent marking and also to be transferrable when wet. The height of its popularity was in the very early 1900s when it served as an easy, permanent writing tool and as a way to copy documents. This later example comes with its own little cap to prevent an inky mess and contains red dye. According to the text on the back of the pencil, it's meant \"for hectograph use\". Note: since this pencil was produced, aniline dye has been found to be quite toxic. It's absolutely safe to use the pencil for its intended purpose, just be sure you don't ingest it. Vintage: 1960s Made in the USA Measures 8\" long Hexagonal barrel Please note that all vintage pencils may have minor flaws due to age and that you can expect the erasers to not work anymore. The pencil you will receive will not necessarily be the one in the photo but definitely one from the same dozen. We've tried our best to accurately capture the quality of the pencil and promise not to sell you something of lesser quality. For Blackwings especially, the ferrules were rarely put on straight. Please do not be alarmed if your ferrule isn't aligned with the text, it won't affect the function or value of the pencil.",

They had violet aniline dye in the core that can transfer when wetted and pressed against another piece of paper. They were most used during WWI as a way to write, sign and make copies of documents quickly and easily as the only other permanent option at the time was a fountain pen, which was messy and more difficult to carry around. Though the aniline dyes originally used have since proven to be toxic, a small number of pencil companies still make contemporary versions.

        "The Summer 2018 Blackwing Volumes release is naturally beautiful, features a unique pentagonal shape and has a particularly interesting background story. As the box reads: \"When Tetsuya Miyamoto invented the KenKenÂ® puzzle in his mathematics classroom in 2004, his goal was to improve his studentsâ problem solving and logic skills. He describes his method as âThe Art of Teaching without Teaching,â and his dream is to make the world smarter with his invention. Today, the KenKenÂ® puzzle is the only puzzle printed daily alongside the New York Times Crossword. Puzzles like these inspire us to apply problem solving and logic in creative ways, letting our minds perform a beautiful dance between their left and right hemispheres. Blackwing 10001 (å£±ä¸å£±) pays tribute to Miyamoto Senseiâs puzzles and other creative ways of teaching and learning. 10001 is a numeral palindrome in Kanji as well as in Arabic numerals. It is also tied to one of Miyamoto Senseiâs favorite equations. The pencil features a red stained barrel, gold imprint and unique five-sided âGÅkaku pencilâ shape. Translated literally from Japanese, GÅkaku means âpassed,â as in a problem or exam. It is also a near-homophone for the Japanese word âGokakukei,â meaning pentagon. GÅkaku pencils are given to every student who graduates from the Miyamoto Mathematics class.\" Made in Japan from California cedar Grade: Ungraded but feels a B or even a 2B (same hardness as a Blackwing 602) Replacement erasers are available here Each pencil measures 8\" long Pentagonal barrel, normal diameter Sold by the dozen",

        "The autumn edition of the ever-popular Blackwing Volumes series is a tribute to another popular analog relic: the vinyl record! Here's the story, from the source: \" From their introduction in the late 1800s, analog records have withstood the advent of radio, the rise and fall of CDs and MP3s, and the dawn of streaming. Rather than be displaced by these more convenient ways of consuming music, the vinyl record has instead shifted from an object of convenience to one of connection. And it has thrived in the process. Just as the way we engage with pencils and notebooks is different from the way we interact with keyboards and touch screens, the way we engage with records is different from the way we interact with digital music. From the rich, uncompressed sound to the album art and liner notes, records tell a story both physically and sonically. According to music icon Henry Rollins, of all the ways to listen to music, âvinyl [best] represents what the musicians wanted you to hear.â The vinyl experience not only creates a physical and emotional connection between music and people, it creates a connection between musicians and their fans. The Blackwing 33 1/3 is a tribute to vinyl records. It features a matte black finish and matte black ferrule to go with its black imprint and black eraser. The gloss black foil banding near the grip was inspired by the grooves on a record.\" Made in Japan from California cedar Grade: Ungraded but feels like a 2B (the same core as the Blackwing Pearl) Replacement erasers are available here Each pencil measures 8\" long Hexagonal barrel, normal diameter Sold by the dozen",

While the engineering designs for the rover and its various instruments are finalized in CAD, its revolutionary robotic arm and zoom-enabled cameras â the first of their kind to be sent to another planet â were first conceptualized in drawings by the team at Motiv Space Systems using Blackwing pencils. Earlier this year, Motiv delivered their assemblies based on these drawings to begin integration onto the rover. In 2020, they will join the Wright brothersâ wrapping paper sketches and Katherine Johnsonâs brilliant calculations as examples of the pencilâs ability to help us reach the sky, space and beyond. The Blackwing 4 is a tribute to Mars and the upcoming rover mission. It features a rust-colored lacquer and sand-textured finish inspired by the surface of the fourth planet.

        "Blaisdell was a pencil company founded in Pennsylvania in the 1890s, during a period of great growth in the American pencil industry. They became known for inventing the China Marker, though their other claim to fame is this pencil: the Blaisdell Calculator 600 \"Special Grade\", a rare specimen known for being part of the \"Steinbeck Trio\", a favorite of John Steinbeck. These pencils are un-graded but they're dark and smooth, with a unique drag to them. Vintage: 1970s Made in the USA Measures 7 1/2\" long Round barrel Please note that all vintage pencils may have minor flaws due to age and that you can expect the erasers to not work anymore. The pencil you will receive will not necessarily be the one in the photo but definitely one from the same dozen. We've tried our best to accurately capture the quality of the pencil and promise not to sell you something of lesser quality. For Blackwings especially, the ferrules were rarely put on straight. Please do not be alarmed if your ferrule isn't aligned with the text, it won't affect the function or value of the pencil.",

The Futura was first made in the 1950s by Richard Best Pencil Company--the same pencil company that made the first triangular pencil, the Try-Rex. The Futura was their snazzy pink version of their flagship pencil, with its wonderful typography and often flashy ferrule. The Futura existed in a few slightly different forms during its existence and is still a highly sought after vintage. Somewhere along the line J.R Moon of Lewisburg, Tennessee acquired the rights to the Try-Rex and the rest of Richard Best's companies so we approached them about bringing our favorite Futura back in a modern way. Though the ability to do a super custom ferrule is limited these days and the odd shaped printing plate necessary for the beveled ages is just short of impossible, we hope you enjoy our 2017 version of this glossy pink beauty.

      "description":
        "The copying pencil is an excellent example of a specialty pencil from a bygone era. It was originally made to contain vibrant purple aniline dye, so that it could be used for permanent marking and also to be transferrable when wet. The height of its popularity was in the very early 1900s when it served as an easy, permanent writing tool and as a way to copy documents. The Mephisto was one of the most popular models in the US during this era--this version is a purple of with a hard lead, which is generally preferable for copying pencils. Note: since this pencil was produced, aniline dye has been found to be quite toxic. It's absolutely safe to use the pencil for its intended purpose, just be sure you don't ingest it. Vintage: 1920s Made in the USA Measures 8\" long Hexagonal barrel Please note that all vintage pencils may have minor flaws due to age and that you can expect the erasers to not work anymore. The pencil you will receive will not necessarily be the one in the photo but definitely one from the same dozen. We've tried our best to accurately capture the quality of the pencil and promise not to sell you something of lesser quality. For Blackwings especially, the ferrules were rarely put on straight. Please do not be alarmed if your ferrule isn't aligned with the text, it won't affect the function or value of the pencil.",

The height of its popularity was in the very early 1900s when it served as an easy, permanent writing tool and as a way to copy documents. This later example comes with its own little cap to prevent an inky mess and contains red dye. According to the text on the back of the pencil, it's meant \"for hectograph use\". Note: since this pencil was produced, aniline dye has been found to be quite toxic. It's absolutely safe to use the pencil for its intended purpose, just be sure you don't ingest it.

        "We'd be willing to bet you've never seen a pencil like this before. It was our very first ever Pencil of the Month because it's that good. It's designed by Japan-based British designer Duncan Shotten and is made from recycled paper, which is tightly wrapped around the pencil to make up the barrel instead of wood. When you sharpen it, the shavings form a rainbow. Too fun? We think so.

The pencils only came in 12 colors and were renowned for being the favorite colored pencil among animators and architects in Japan. Their hard, highly pigmented lead was preferred to fine line drawing. Panic ensued and stores very quickly sold out of every color.

        "Copying pencils were first introduced in the 1870s as a form of âinkâ pencil that couldnât be erased. They had violet aniline dye in the core that can transfer when wetted and pressed against another piece of paper. They were most used during WWI as a way to write, sign and make copies of documents quickly and easily as the only other permanent option at the time was a fountain pen, which was messy and more difficult to carry around. Though the aniline dyes originally used have since proven to be toxic, a small number of pencil companies still make contemporary versions. The core in this one is a classic copying pencil purple and is non-toxic. Viarco is Portugal's one and only pencil factory.

One the best parts, too, is that all these lovely pages are sandwiched between two pocket pages (you know, for stickers) and a super heavy, sturdy cover. Made in Malaysia with 100gsm Italian Paper Measures 8\" x 5.5\" 160 pages",

      "title": "The Pencil Perfect by Caroline Weaver",
      "price": 40.0,
      "description":
        "The Pencil Perfect takes its namesakeâs four simple ingredients â wood, graphite, clay, and water â and narrates a tale of worldwide influence and innovation. Caroline Weaver, pencil connoisseur and CW Pencil Enterprise Shop owner, composes texts that extol the nuanced influence of her beloved and humble implement. Illustrations exclusively drawn for The Pencil Perfect by Oriana Fenwick, an artist from Zimbabwe who works with fine details and intense realism, pair with Weaverâs words to present a story that is both endearing and enlightening. Through profiles of pencil makers, anecdotes about famous writersâ favorite pencils, and essays about the surprising role of pencils in world history and culture, the chronicle of a modest but mighty tool unfolds. Follow the charming contrivance as it guides the course of early communication in the Scientific Revolution, the American Revolutionary War, the Anglo-French War, and the French Revolution: it is a historical journey and a captivating memoir. See how its past contemporarily compares with its use and appearance today â from the Blackwing 602 to novelty ferrules. The development of cultures and communities is laid bare within the timeline of this slender entity. The Pencil Perfect immortalizes the biography of an inanimate object within its pages for a future cast of historians, writers, and curious minds.

In other words, the work you do on the computer is what you do for work, to pay the rent, whereas the stuff you do with your pencil is the stuff you do for fun. Apart from stimulating the world's most important creative minds, the pencil has become the modern creative's ultimate fetish. This book presents a unique collection of close-up pictures of pencils from some of our foremost artists, designers, writers, architects, and musicians. What makes these pictures compelling is the fact that they somehow reflect the creative personalities of their owners: Philippe Starck's is a stylish black and red, Paul Smith's is a classic jewel-like thing worth Â£3,000 (a present from Jonathan Ive), William Boyd's is nicely aged and rusty, while Anish Kapoor's is sculpted into a mini ArcelorMittal Orbital tower. The pictures are complemented by materials such as sketches, quotes and brief interviews, giving a further insight into the workings of these great creative minds.Hardback 143 Pages ISBN: 9781786270832 Published by Laurence King Publishing",

        "Samantha is a Brooklyn based graphic designer and illustrator who has amassed a following on social media through her daily sketch journaling. She's been a friend of the shop since the very beginning and we're so thrilled about her new pair of books. This pack includes a selection of some of Samantha's favorite pencils, a copy of her book Draw Your Day and the companion sketchbook. Let Samantha guide you through learning the art of sketch journaling with easy to follow instructions and advice and just the right tools to get started. The pencil set includes one of each of the following pencils: Palomino Blackwing Pearl Pencil - While this pencil has been compared to a 2B, I find it closer to a 3B in smoothness and darkness. It's a gorgeous object with a rich history--and it's lovely to photograph. General's Kimberly Pencil in B - Green is my favorite color and one of my closest friends shares its name, so I liked it from the moment I saw it. Caran d'Ache Swiss Wood Pencil - It's the hardest pencil I use but I find it so lovely to draw with. It's subtly heavier, holds its point longer than most pencils, is a beautiful dark wood with a red end and even smells nice. Viarco Art Graf 2B Pencil - This pencil writes similarly to a 2B and is a bit like charcoal. Also, it's water-soluble, which allows you to give your drawings a wash of water for a painterly effect. Tombow Mono KM-KKS 6B Pencil - To round out the collection, I wanted to have a very soft, dark graphite pencil. The Mono is exceptionally buttery, smooth and excellent for drawing. Viking Verso 4B/HB Pencil - I discovered this pencil the day we chose the pack. It's double-ended, so you'll need pencil caps for this one. One end is soft and the other is firmer for writing. Sakura Sumo Mini Eraser - A hard-working, portable plastic eraser perfect for eliminating dark graphite messes.",

The high-quality graphite and platinum-plated hardware make this the Perfect tool for those who write, draw, or simply enjoy fine analog tools. Prior to the 20th century, the famous pencil firm went by the name A.W Faber until heiress Baroness Ottilie von Faber married Count Alexander zu Castell-RÃ¼denhausen. They legally changed their last names to Faber-Castell in order to use it as the new name for the family business. The Graf von Faber-Castell line (translated literally as the Count of Faber-Castell) celebrates the tradition and history of this esteemed company. Made in Germany Measures 6 inches assembled Pencil measures 5 1/4 inches Cap measures 3 inches Sold individually This set comes with 1 pencil. You can find the appropriately sized refills here.
